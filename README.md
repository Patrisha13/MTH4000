# MTH4000
Hi, I hope I have done this correctly and that you can give me full marks for my 'Test 2'.
Additionally, Iâ€™ve encountered an issue with the submission process. While my code runs successfully in Jupyter Notebook, it fails to execute properly when submitted through QMPLUS. I believe this may be related to the system, and I wanted to ask if this impacts the grading. Specifically, would a failure to run on QMPLUS result in the loss of all marks, even if the code functions correctly in a local environment?
